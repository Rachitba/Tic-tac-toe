# üéÆ Tic Tac Toe - C++ Console Game

A simple yet complete implementation of the classic **Tic Tac Toe** game using **C++**. This terminal-based two-player game is built using fundamental programming concepts, showcasing clean logic, modularity, and STL-based dynamic memory usage with `std::vector`.

---

## üöÄ Project Overview

This project recreates the nostalgic experience of playing Tic Tac Toe on a 3√ó3 grid. Two players take turns placing their symbols (`X` or `O`) on the board, with the first to align three symbols in a row, column, or diagonal winning the game. The game also includes:

- Input validation for correct symbol and position entries
- Real-time board updates after each move
- Full game loop with replay support
- Draw condition detection

---

## üß∞ Technologies & Tools

- **Language:** C++
- **Standard Library:** `vector`, `iostream`
- **Concepts Used:**
  - 2D and 1D Arrays using `std::vector`
  - Conditional logic for win checking
  - Looping and user input handling
  - Modular and clean code structure

---

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Run

### üì¶ Prerequisites
- A C++ compiler (e.g. `g++`, `clang++`)
- Terminal or Command Prompt

### üß™ Compile & Execute
```bash
g++ main.cpp -o tictactoe
./tictactoe
```

---

## üéØ Features

- üß† Smart validation for moves and symbols
- üìä Real-time grid updates after each move
- üåÄ Option to replay without restarting the program
- üèÅ Detects all possible win conditions and draw scenarios
- üß© Compact use of memory with dynamic arrays (vectors)

## üéÆ Gameplay Example

```
Welcome to Tic Tac Toe!
Player 1- Enter your symbol from X/O: X
Player 2's symbol is: O

Player 1- Enter position: 0 0
Grid:
X _ _
_ _ _
_ _ _

Player 2- Enter position: 1 1
...
```
